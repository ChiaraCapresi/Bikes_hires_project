# Bikes_hires_project
 
In this projects I analysed a dataset collecting data from a company of bikes' hires, "NYC City Bikes", located in New York. The aim of the project was that of doing preliminary cleaning and wrangling data operations I considered useful for the further analysis, and answering to specific business requirements on a basis of visualisations of crucial variables of the dataset and execution of appropriate statistics hypothesis testing.


## Business requirements

The three main questions we were asked to focus on are the following:


1.  What is the pattern of bike hires over time?
2.  Do bike hire patterns differ between bike rider demographics?
3.  What is the geographical spread of the start points of bike hires?

As a first step, after having had a first look at the dataset, I operated a series of cleaning and wrangling operations that I thought were useful being aware of the further analysis that the three questions required.


Then, for each of the three questions, I produced visualisations and gave explanations of my theses.

## Repository structure:

I used the *nyc_bikes* dataset from the **tsibbledata** package. 

The cleaning operations were quite limited, since the main focus of the project was that of making visualisations and providing appropriate explanations. For this reason, I didn't write the cleaned data anywhere.


In this repository, in addition to this README file, there is a .Rmd and an html versions of my report and of my presentation.
